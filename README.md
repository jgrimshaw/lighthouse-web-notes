## False
All of the following are inherently falsey:
* False - False is False. Makes sense, right?
* 0 - 0 is the only falsey Number
* ' ' - an empty string is falsey
* `[ ]` - empty array.length is falsey
* null - a null, or empty value, is falsey.
* undefined - an object that has not been defined is considered falsey.
* NaN - Not a Number. You'll learn more about NaN as we go on.
